Branch is a new and separate branch of the master repo

In a big project, we separate the tasks/features and create branch so editing in the new branch does not affect the master branch

git branch -> tells you how many branches are there

git branch branch-name -> creates a new branch similar to master 

git branch -r -> tells you about remote branch in app

git merge branch-name  -> merges the branch with master branch

git branch -d branch-name  -> deletes the branch
