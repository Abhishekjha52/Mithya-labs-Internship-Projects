You should have github account as well to use git


working directory -> staging area -> local repo -> remote rep0

git-fun -> git add fileName -> git commit  -> git push


git status check what chagbges you have done, it is mainly used in staging area

git also has tracked and untracked files. Git can track files when files are in stagin area and local repo

git add filename -> will push from drirectory to staging area

Instead of pushing each file by filename, we can push all files at once by writing command
        git add .


git restore filename will go back to the previous changes of the file.

for controlling changes, staging area is enough, but to control the version, we need to move file from staging area to local repo


git commit -> is used to move files from staging to locl repo
command is git commit -m "message"

git log  -> tells you the no of commits you did in local repo

git log --oneline  -> gives info about commits in one line


git reset --soft HEAD^  -> can go back to staging area from local repo



git checkout id -> heps us to move to another version of our code


git checkout master -> will bring you to the updated commit
